- Explored regional sales distribution using shape maps to visualize sales by geographical locations.
- Investigated sales seasonality by analyzing monthly and yearly sales trends using time intelligence functions and slicers.
- Visualized sales performance over time by product category using slicers, cards and area charts to analyze sales in a period of time.
