### Data Cleaning/Preparation

The following steps were taken in the data cleaning stage:
- I split the dataset into different sheets and merged multiple datasets together based on commonalities to create a unified dataset
- I reordered columns to organize data in a more logical sequence
- I used image links of the products to be analyzed from Adidas

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved: 
- Created a sales dashboard displaying key metrics such as total revenue (sales), quantity sold, average price at which a unit of the product is sold, number of transactions done and profit made.
- Explored regional sales distribution using shape maps to visualize sales by geographical locations.
- Investigated sales seasonality by analyzing monthly and yearly sales trends using time intelligence functions and slicers.
- Visualized sales performance over time by product category using slicers, cards and area charts to analyze sales in a period of time.
- Visualized sales trends over time using slicers and area charts to identify seasonal patterns and trends.
- Analyzed sales performance by product category, retailer and region using bar charts to identify top-selling categories and underperforming ones.
- Examined sales by sales channel (e.g., online, outlet, in-store) using slicers in comparison to other charts created to understand the effectiveness of each channel.
- Created an Area chart to visualize the trend of monthly profit and total sales over time, enabling the identification of any seasonal patterns or trends.
- Conducted a year-over-year analysis by adding a slicer to compare the monthly profit and total sales across different years, facilitating trend analysis and year-on-year comparisons.
- Created a Line chart to visualize the trend of monthly sales and total sales over time, enabling the identification of any seasonal patterns or trends.
- Conducted a year-over-year analysis by adding a slicer to compare the monthly sales and total sales across different years, facilitating trend analysis and year-on-year comparisons.
- Utilized DAX measures to calculate profit margin ratios and compare them with the average operating margin, enabling assessment of profitability and efficiency in converting sales into profit.
- Utilized a Line and Stacked column chart to compare the trend of monthly profit against the average operating margin to provide insights into profitability
- Utilized a slicer to filter the data by specific retailer, sales channels (method) or year enabling focused analysis and comparison of monthly profit and average operating margin within selected segments.

### Results

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different sales methods over time. The analysis results are summarized as follows:

- The analysis indicates that Men's street footwear is the top-selling category across every sales channel, while women's athletic footwear is the least-selling category across all sales channel.
- From examining sales by retailers, West Gear has the highest sales In-store while Footlocker has the highest sales Online and in Outlets
- After analysis, insights derived show that West Gear and Footlocker were the highest performing retailers among all retailers. They accounted for 27% and 24.46% of the total sales volume respectively while Amazon was the lowest performing retailer with 8.63% of the total sales volume.
-  This analysis shows that In-store sales were the most profitable while online sales had the least profit. 
- 

### Recommendations
- The sales teamshould focus on increasing In-store sales and improving online sales.
- Implement reward or incentive programs for the highest grossing retailers (West Gear and Footlocker) to recognize and incentivize their performance. Partnership with these retailers on collaborative marketing initiatives such as co-branded campaigns or sponsorships to increase brand visibility could also ensure more demand for products.
- For low grossing retailers (Walmart and Amazon), factors such as location and visibility of products are some of the problems faced by these retailers. Providing these retailers with exclusive deals, discounts or performance-based bonuses to incentivize them to increase their sales effort would improve their sales performance.
