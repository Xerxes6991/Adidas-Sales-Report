### Recommendations
- The sales teamshould focus on increasing In-store sales and improving online sales.
- Implement reward or incentive programs for the highest grossing retailers (West Gear and Footlocker) to recognize and incentivize their performance. Partnership with these retailers on collaborative marketing initiatives such as co-branded campaigns or sponsorships to increase brand visibility could also ensure more demand for products.
- For low grossing retailers (Walmart and Amazon), factors such as location and visibility of products are some of the problems faced by these retailers. Providing these retailers with exclusive deals, discounts or performance-based bonuses to incentivize them to increase their sales effort would improve their sales performance.
